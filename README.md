# Olivia Ruth Arts 

Olivia Ruth Arts is an Art portfolio site that was built over a five day sprint from design to launch. This project was developed as the final solo project in the Turing School of Software and Design bootcamp. The goal of this project was to demonstrate mastery of React, React Router, Asynchronous JavaScript and End to end testing with Cypress.

### Planning
- For the project requirements I was tasked to create two user personas to describe the target audience.

 - I also created Wireframes and ran the design by Olivia before starting to code

### Wins:
- I loved working with my younger sister to create this art portfolio for her. We collaborated on design decisions, and I kept her updated throughout the process. It feels very fulfilling to use the skills I gained at the Turing School of Software and Design to create a practical application to show off my sister's artwork! 

### Challenges 
- The photos of the art on the site are slow to load. I'm still working on this issue and am looking into possible solutions.
